<h2>Snake-Game</h2>
<p>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food items to grow longer. 
The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls of the playing area or with the snake's own tail. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging.</p>
