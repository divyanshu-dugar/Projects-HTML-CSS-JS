<h2>Games in this Respository</h2>
<h2>Snake-Game</h2>
<p>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food items to grow longer. 
The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls of the playing area or with the snake's own tail. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging.</p>
<h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 
The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). 
The outcome of the game is determined by the chosen shapes: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.</p>
<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol, usually "X" or "O", with the objective 
of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before their opponent does. The game ends in a draw if all squares are 
filled without either player achieving a winning combination.</p>
